                <p>Web Rebels 2012 was a blast! We are still buzzing with excitement after having hosted our first ever conference. It was an amazing two days and we couldn’t have done this without the support of some of the web developer community in Norway. Our community is as viral as ever and a lot of brilliant people are putting in a lot of work. We know that pulling the strings in a community can be a lot of work and without financial support you can not accomplish everything you want to.</p>
                <p>The Web Rebels have decided to use 30% of this years profits from ticket sales to help the web developer community. If you host a meet up or similar community event you can send us an email and we might help you out.</p>
